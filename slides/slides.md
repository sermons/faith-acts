But someone will say, <br/>
“**You** have faith; **I** have deeds.”

Show me your faith **without** deeds, <br/>

Was not our father **Abraham** <br/>

And the scripture was fulfilled that says, <br/>
“Abraham **believed** God, <br/>

There was a man who had two sons.
He went to the first and said,
"Son, go and work today in the vineyard."

<span class="ref">29</span>
"I will not," he answered,
but later he changed his mind and went.

<span class="ref">30</span>
Then the father went to the other son
and said the same thing.

He answered, "I will, sir," but he did not go.

>>>
+ **integrity**: one whole person

After this, the word of the Lord <br/>
came to Abram in a vision:

“Do not be afraid, Abram. <br/>
I am your **shield**, your very great **reward**.”

But Abram said, “Sovereign Lord, <br/>
what can you give me since I remain **childless** <br/>
and the one who will inherit my estate <br/>
is Eliezer of Damascus?”

Then the word of the Lord came to him: <br/>
“This man will not be your heir, <br/>

He took him outside and said, <br/>
“Look up at the **sky** and count the **stars** <br/>
-- if indeed you can **count** them.”

Then he said to him, <br/>
“So shall your **offspring** be.”

Abram **believed** the Lord, <br/>
and he **credited** it to him as **righteousness**.

+ *Gal* highlights this as

Then God said, <br/>
“Take your **son**, your **only** son, <br/>
whom you **love** -- **Isaac** -- <br/>
and go to the region of Moriah.

**Sacrifice** him there as a **burnt offering** <br/>
on a mountain I will show you.”

<span class="ref">(Gal 3:8)</span>
Scripture foresaw that God would
**justify** the Gentiles **by faith**,
and announced the **gospel** in advance to Abraham:

“**All nations** will be **blessed** through you.”

So those who **rely on faith**
are **blessed** along with Abraham, the **man of faith**.
