if it is not accompanied by **action**, is **dead**.

But someone will say, <br/>
“**You** have faith; **I** have deeds.”

Show me your faith **without** deeds, <br/>
and I will show you my faith **by** my deeds.

You believe that there is **one God**. Good! <br/>
Even the **demons** believe that — and shudder.

You foolish person, do you want **evidence** <br/>
that faith without deeds is **useless**?

were working **together**, <br/>
and his faith was made **complete** <br/>
by what he did.

<span class="ref">23</span>
And the scripture was fulfilled that says, <br/>
“Abraham **believed** God, <br/>
and it was credited to him as **righteousness**,” <br/>
and he was called God’s **friend**.

---
<span class="ref">24</span>
You see that a person is considered **righteous** <br/>
by what they **do** and not by faith **alone**.

## Faith that Acts <span class="ref">(Jam2)</span>
1. Good **Intentions** <span class="ref">(17)</span>

Suppose a brother or a sister is </br>
without **clothes** and daily **food**.

Was not our father **Abraham** <br/>
considered **righteous** for what he did <br/>
when he **offered** his son Isaac on the altar?

---
<span class="ref">(Gen 22:2)</span>
Then God said, <br/>
“Take your son, your only son, <br/>
whom you love -- Isaac -- <br/>
and go to the region of Moriah.

Sacrifice him there as a burnt offering <br/>
on a mountain I will show you.”

<span class="ref">(Gen 15:1)</span>
After this, the word of the Lord <br/>
came to Abram in a vision:

“Do not be afraid, Abram. <br/>
I am your shield, your very great reward.”

<span class="ref">(Gen 15:2)</span>
But Abram said, “Sovereign Lord, <br/>
what can you give me since I remain childless <br/>
and the one who will inherit my estate <br/>
is Eliezer of Damascus?”

Then the word of the Lord came to him: <br/>
“This man will not be your heir, <br/>
but a son who is your own flesh and blood <br/>
will be your heir.”

<span class="ref">(Gen 15:5)</span>
He took him outside and said, <br/>
“Look up at the sky and count the stars <br/>
-- if indeed you can count them.”

Then he said to him, <br/>
“So shall your offspring be.”

Abram believed the Lord, <br/>
and he credited it to him as righteousness.
