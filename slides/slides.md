In the same way, **faith** by itself, <br/>
if it is not accompanied by **action**, is **dead**.

<span class="ref">18</span>
But someone will say, <br/>
“**You** have faith; **I** have deeds.”

---
Show me your faith **without** deeds, <br/>
and I will show you my faith **by** my deeds.

<span class="ref">19</span>
You believe that there is **one God**. Good! <br/>
Even the **demons** believe that — and shudder.

<span class="ref">20</span>
You foolish person, do you want **evidence** <br/>
that faith without deeds is **useless**?

<span class="ref">21</span>
Was not our father **Abraham** <br/>
considered **righteous** for what he did <br/>
when he **offered** his son Isaac on the altar?

---
<span class="ref">22</span>
You see that his **faith** and his **actions** <br/>
were working **together**, <br/>
and his faith was made **complete** <br/>
by what he did.

---
<span class="ref">23</span>
And the scripture was fulfilled that says, <br/>
“Abraham **believed** God, <br/>
and it was credited to him as **righteousness**,” <br/>
and he was called God’s **friend**.

<span class="ref">24</span>
You see that a person is considered **righteous** <br/>
by what they **do** and not by faith **alone**.
