In the same way, faith by itself, <br/>
if it is not accompanied by action, is dead.

But someone will say, <br/>
“You have faith; I have deeds.”

---
Show me your faith without deeds, <br/>
and I will show you my faith by my deeds.

You believe that there is one God. Good! <br/>
Even the demons believe that — and shudder.

---
You foolish person, do you want evidence <br/>
that faith without deeds is useless?

Was not our father Abraham <br/>
considered righteous for what he did <br/>
when he offered his son Isaac on the altar?

---
You see that his faith and his actions <br/>
were working together, <br/>
and his faith was made complete <br/>
by what he did.

---
And the scripture was fulfilled that says, <br/>
“Abraham believed God, <br/>
and it was credited to him as righteousness,” <br/>
and he was called God’s friend.

You see that a person is considered righteous <br/>
by what they do and not by faith alone.
